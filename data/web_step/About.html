			<h2>About OpenMYR</h2>
			<p>OpenMYR is a 3 person startup based in Syracuse, NY. OpenMYR is dedicated to making open source products that enable imagination and creativity. We have a wide skill set and are driven to make novel designs and creations. We are excited to be putting products in the hands of the community, and we look forward to your feedback!
 			<h2>About This Product</h2>
			<p>OpenMYR WiFi motors can be controled via WiFi, or programed with an Arduino sketch. At the core of the system is an Espressif ESP8266. The design and code for this product are open source and avalible at <a href="http://www.Github.com/OpenMYR">Github.com/OpenMYR</a>.</p>
			<h2>About the Future</h2>
			<p>This is our debut product, we are confident in its abilities, but it may have a couple of kinks. We will be releasing new firmware as issues are fixed, and the firmware can be loaded in over WiFi. Don't hesitate to email us at Contact@OpenMYR.com with any concerns or problems. We also have quite a few new features in the works and can't wait to deploy them. Ask to join our mailing list or follow us on social media for infromation on updates.</p>
